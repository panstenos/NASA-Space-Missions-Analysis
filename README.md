# NASA-Space-Missions-Analysis
Exploring Nasa's space missions

## <u>Overview</u>
The main objective of this project is to predict the recovery rate of future rockets based on NASA's space missions. To achieve that, EDA was performed using SQL, matplotlib and folium on various datasets and databases consisting of metadata of NASA's past missions. This project was the CAPSTONE project of 'IBM Data Science Professional Certificate' offered thorugh Coursera.

## <u>Context</u>
Space missions are becoming cheaper and cheaper because the advanced technological framework has allowed for the development of rockets whose first stage is reusable. The ability to reuse the first stage can save more than 100 million dollars and thus has a significant  impact on space travel and exploration! SpaceX advertises that Falcon 9 rocket launches will cost only 62 million dollars as its first stage can be reused. 

## <u>Insight Drawn from EDA</u>
1. All launch sites have very close proximity to the sea. Being located close to the sea provides a safe and convenient area for rocket stages to dall back after lanch, minimizing the risk to populated areas and fascilitating water-based recovery operations.
2. All launch sites have very close proximity to railways and highways. This enables efficient transportation of heavy rocket components and fascilitates logistical support for space missions.
3. KSC LC-39A is the launch site with the highest probability of a succeful launch (76.9%)
4. Heavy weighted rockets are more likely to be recovered compared to lighter ones
5. Orbits GEO, HEO, SSO and ES-L1 have the best success rate of all orbits
